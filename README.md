# Arithmetic Class


Create a C++ class called Arithmetic that has four member functions: add, subtract, multiply, and divide. 

Each member function should take two integer arguments and return the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation.    

The divide function should also check if the second argument is zero, and if it is, throw a std::runtime_error with the message "Cannot divide by zero.  

## Compiling and Running
```
g++ main.cpp arithmetic.cpp
./a.out
```
